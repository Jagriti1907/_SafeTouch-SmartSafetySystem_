# SafeTouch – One-Tap Smart Personal Safety System  
**SkyHack Round-2 Submission**  
Developer: Jagriti Singh

---

##  Overview  
SafeTouch is a rapid-response personal safety system designed to deliver instant protection through a **single-touch activation mechanism**.  
The system autonomously triggers SOS mode, streams live GPS coordinates, captures situational evidence, and alerts guardians in real time.

The objective is to eliminate delays during emergencies and provide a fast, reliable and technology-driven solution for women’s safety.
